# Biography

Rob Patro is an assistant professor in the Computer Science department at Stony Brook University. Previously, I was a postdoctoral research associate working with professor Carl Kingsford in the Lane Center for computational biology at Carnegie Mellon University. I obtained my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park, and defended my dissertation, Computationally Comparing Biological Networks and Reconstructing Their Evolution. My main academic interests include computational biology and bioinformatics, machine learning, programming languages, computer graphics, scientific visualization and parallel computation. I also have recreational interests in math, physics, music, politics and video games. While at Maryland, I've also had the pleasure of working closely with professor Amitabh Varshney on some problems relating to computer graphics and scientific visualization.
